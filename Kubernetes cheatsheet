Kubernetes commans 
Label and selectors:
$ kubectl get pods --selector env=dev (check key/Values)
$ kubectl get all --selector env=prod --no-headers | wc -l
$ kubectl get pods --selector env=prod,bu=finance,tier=frontend

Taints and toleration
taints are applied to node and toleration are applied to the pods
$ kubectl taint node <nodename> key=value:taint-effect

below are the taint-effect
1. NoSchedule
2. PreferNoSchedule
3. NoExecute

$ kubectl taint node node01 app=blue:NoSchedule

toleration simpliified(array)
tolerations:
- key:
  operator:
  value:
  effect:
  
  *** Toleration in pods doesn't guarantees that pods will be schedule only to the tainted node. ***
  
  and above is the limitaion of toleration hence there is a concept known "Affinity" comes into picture.

    *  A taint consists of a key, value, and effect. As an argument here, it is
expressed as key=value:effect.
  *  The key must begin with a letter or number, and may contain letters,
numbers, hyphens, dots, and underscores, up to 253 characters.
  *  Optionally, the key can begin with a DNS subdomain prefix and a single '/',
like example.com/my-app.
  *  The value is optional. If given, it must begin with a letter or number, and
may contain letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, and underscores, up to 63
characters.
  *  The effect must be NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule or NoExecute.
  *  Currently taint can only apply to no
