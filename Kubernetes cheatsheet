Taints and toleration
taints are applied to node and toleration are applied to the pods
$ kubectl taint node <nodename> key=value:taint-effect

below are the taint-effect
1. NoSchedule
2. PreferNoSchedule
3. NoExecute

$ kubectl taint node node01 app=blue:NoSchedule

toleration simpliified(array)
tolerations:
- key:
  operator:
  value:
  effect:
  
  *** Toleration in pods doesn't guarantees that pods will be schedule only to the tainted node. ***
  
  and above is the limitaion of toleration hence there is a concept known "Affinity" comes into picture.
